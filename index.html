            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A static website is one that has web pages stored on the server in the
                format that is sent to a client web browser. It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML);
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML. Images are commonly used
                to effect the desired appearance and as part of the main content. Audio or video might also be
                considered "static" content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive. This type of
                website usually displays the same information to all visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure
                to customers or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an
                extended period of time. Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual
                process to edit the text, photos and other content and may require basic website design skills and
                software. Simple forms or marketing examples of websites,

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are many open source tools for web development such as BerkeleyDB,
                GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web
                development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of
                easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft
                Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still
                required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly.

                An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive
                websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which were
                traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer..</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a
                global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World
                Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.[2] In 1993 Marc
                Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however
                the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to
                graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.[3] The W3C was
                created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols
                that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."[4] This discouraged any one company from
                monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the
                World Wide Web as a whole.</p>
